Photos and color sharing website where users can upload photos and have it analyzed for color and grouped by themes. 



Its primary use is for users to collate a collection of color palettes paired with their original source for greater appreciation of color in design.



Its secondary use of for designers to analyze color use through image uploads and offer varying color palettes to serve as inspiration for other projects.



Allows users to upload images that are deconstructed

 into color palettes following color harmony theory for comparison and informative purposes.

Users can browse content by themes, color, color harmony type and view content from other user's



In color theory there are several color harmony types, analogous, complemmentary ....

Each of them used to create a different feel: for example ....



If I am a casual user who really likes pokemon, I can upload images of pokemon and get information on its color composition.



This pokemon is dominantly blue and follows a more analogous color scheme...

I can look at the other colors harmonies derived from this and imagine how different variations for this color can play out on this same pokemon.

Provide people a richer way of understanding color.

I can group it together with other pokemon and appreciate them together.



If I'm a designer wanting to design products around the lapras, I could copy color codes for the palette for new designs. Alternatively, I can browse the all post according to color, harmony types... to get ideas.





Hello All! Welcome to the demo of instant hue.

Instant hue is a site for generating color combinations from images you love based on color harmony.

Color harmony in color theory refers to the pleasing combinations of colors its often use to achieve certain moods or aesthetics.

There are different types of color harmonies in color theory, analogous, rectangle complementary ... and so on. Its easy to explore , but the options can be infinite. 

Sometimes, I would like to make designs inspired by images i like.

On instant hue, these color combinations can be extracted easily.

I start by uploading an image by its url or by a file upload

I find this image on goolgle images ... copy its url and add it here.

Fill in a category

and click the upload button

In a bit, the base colors of the image will be extracted.

Along with this, seven other color combinations have been generated sorted according to how close they are to the original colors.

From this I can make comparisons, instead of using an analogous color template, I could also consider the split complementary or rectangle color combinations.

The hex codes from the palette can be copied for use in other projects.



If I don't have any image in mind and want to browse other color combinations.

I could go back to the main page. Sort by hue,  filter by color harmonies, and pick by color using the rainbow slider.

These images are also viewable thematically through categories.

I'm re	ally interested in the pokemon color selection. I can click on pokemon and view all images related to pokemon

Alternatively I can also explore what others have uploaded on the 'Users' tab.

From here rick is interested in pokemon, while fin is interested in wes-anderson. If i like fin's feed, i can click on 'fin' to view his other uploads.
