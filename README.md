<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Instant Hue is an app for studying color and for generating color templates from image uploads

**It will:**

1. Analyze your photos for its dominant colors.
2. Match the photo to its closest color harmony type.
3. Show color palettes in other color schemes for further inspiration.

**It allows:**

1. Jpg uploads by url and file upload.
2. Categorization into groups.
3. Viewing by categories.
4. Sorting by Hue, time uploaded.
5. Filtering by color.
6. Copying of Hex color codes by clicking on the circular palette.



Color harmony types include analogous, complementary, double-split-complementary, rectangle, split-complementary, tetradic, and triadic. These are ranked from closest to furthest in similarity to the original colors of the image upload
